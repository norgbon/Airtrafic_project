Predict Air Traffic by routes

The aim is to predict the number of passengers on flight routes from a point of departure to a point of arrival. The aim is to predict the number of passengers on the following days, according to the number of days the user would have wanted, in order to get an estimate. The total possible number of days to predict is 366.

The database used contains traffic data from January 2016 to March 2023.
Depending on the point of departure and arrival, the user can obtain the necessary information from the database, the traffic graph and finally the prediction based on the number of days defined by the user.

The visualization was developed in an application using Streamlit. The link to the application is as follows: https://norgbon-airtrafic-project-app-c9i4ds.streamlit.app/
